# Tensorflow:

A collection of projects implemented in [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Installing Tensorflow:
**Note:** <br>
It's a good practice to have working environments(Virtual environments) but if you like, you can go ahead and install Tensorflow globally.
> * Installing Tensorflow (Ubuntu): 
    * ```pip install jupyterthemes``` 
    * upgrade to the latest version ```pip install --upgrade jupyterthemes```
   
> * The [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) website has well elaborated procedures so please refer to it 
as I don't want to rewrite them here.<br>
